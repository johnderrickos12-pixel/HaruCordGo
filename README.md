# HaruCordGo v1.00

High-performance, modded communications environment with native bypass protocols and integrated kernel logic.

## Core Features
- **Rate-Limit Bypass Engine**: Intelligent request queuing to circumvent API throttling and ensure message delivery.
- **Turbo-Typing Focus Lock**: Forces hardware input focus for maximum typing velocity on mobile devices.
- **Global Glass UI**: 100% transparency architecture optimized for high-fidelity custom backgrounds.
- **CLI Kernel**: Integrated terminal for direct system interaction and script execution.

## Whitelist Status
To unlock the "Whitelisted" badge and full engine priority:
1. Set your Discord status to exactly: `#haru on top`
2. The Harumi Engine will verify the signature via the heartbeat protocol every 2 seconds.

## Installation & Setup
For the intended experience and to enable the OAuth2 authentication layer, HaruCordGo must be installed as a native system app.
- **Desktop Setup**: Click the "Desktop Install" module on the startup interface or use your browser's "Install App" feature.
- **Mobile Setup**: Use the browser's "Add to Home Screen" function to link the binary to your device.
*Note: OAuth2 authentication is exclusively active when running within the installed application environment.*
